<h1>Mission: Save The Ally and Fight Against the Emperor</h1>
<h2>Background: One year after the Battle of Endor in Star Wars.</h2> 

Hi my friend. Although Galactic Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader is already dead, their "loyal" army and forces is still around the galaxty and bring fear to people on other planets. More bad news, according to our intelligence, we have found that a large number of Galactic Empire troops are hoarding around the Jakku planet. Our guess: there will be a massive battle broke out between the New Republic and the Galactic Empire on the planet Jakku. If we win, this battle will affect more than 500 years of the galaxy's history and the development of the New Republic. If we lose. . . Well, we must win, we must win! We're running out of time, we need to go right away and help our allies on Jakku. Let's go!


<h4>Question: What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect?  If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing? (This last bit might be more relevant with later, more complex assignments.) </h4>

Because I love the star war movie and I want to create a speech that before the battle of Jakku. (You can also understand as the mission report and a speech). This report can lead the player(reader) to full fill or integration into the moment of battle. I think my mission report achieve that effect and will bring people know more about the star war.
